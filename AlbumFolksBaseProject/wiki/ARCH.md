# Implementation Details

FlowChart to explain Data flow between volatile models / viewcontrollers / persistent models through the use of ViewPopulators

![Data Flow for Stored Content](https://github.com/carloscorreia94/AlbumFolks/blob/master/wiki/data_flow.png)

## ViewPopulators

[Defined here](https://github.com/carloscorreia94/AlbumFolks/tree/master/AlbumFolks/views/populators) for the ease of view data injection. Abstraction to allow for bidirectional data entry in the AlbumVC. All persistence is then naturally created/fetched through indirection of these objects.

Refer to [this test class](https://github.com/carloscorreia94/AlbumFolks/tree/master/AlbumFolksTests/AlbumVCEntryPointsTests.swift) to guide you in the diagram for the user journey through the usual app navigation process (AlbumVC core ViewController).

## ArtistPopulator
Defined as part of AlbumViewPopulator, same goes for TrackViewPopulator (multiple instances).
Also, because an user can be redirected from a Stored Album to the Artist Page (shortcut not initially considered on the design), ArtistPopulator struct gets to be populated outside the normal context , which would be at Albums CollectionView click (either on StoredAlbumsVC or ArtistAlbumsVC). This is why it is defined under the **models/supplementary folder** instead of the views/populators.

## Album Identifiers

An album (coming from LastFM Api upon collective album info request for the artist) gets identified by either it's mbid (musicbrainzid) or combination name&&artist-name. There's a lot of albums with no associated mbid that can get their detail fetched anyways. So I resourced to this knowledge and created a hashValue for the album based on having associated mbid or just the string identifier. So the appropriate resource gets called upon AlbumDetail fetch. 


## Lazy Album Info Download

You may have noticed that there's no loading associated for the AlbumVC. This is because I download the album detail info as the user navigates through the albums information (ArtistAlbumVC). This way we have a more fluid experience.

## ImageDownload Mechanism

At the time of this implementation I wasn't sure if AlamofireImage would store the album art undefinetelly or just cache it, so I resourced to my own mechanism of file storage. If an album gets downloaded, having an available cover art, it gets saved to the device (upon image download by Alamofire). When loading downloaded album info (initial page), I try to locate it's photo (based on the hashValue). In the negative case, having a photoURL associated (stored attribute), we try to fetch the image again and download it. The reason for this, is that sometimes I experienced failures on imageDownload from the API or even storage by the iOS FileSystem API.
